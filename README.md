# Career_Aspiration_4.1.4
Unit 4 Lesson 1 Assignment 4

## Write your own story

## Estimated Time: 2-3 hours

Think about your ideal career two or three years from now. What particular skills have you built? What techniques and tools are your specialty? What accomplishments might you have made? Is your title "Data Scientist", or something different? Are you working in a particular industry, or solving a particular class of problems?

For this final assignment you have writing prompts about the ideal job you envision above. Write responses to each and add them to your planning document.

* Describe your ideal job in one or two paragraphs as though you're talking with an industry professional. They're familiar with the business and with the culture, they know the jargon and the buzzwords. Focus on the skills, tools, and / or industry you hope to deeply specialize in.

My ideal job in the datascience field is to work on the sales side of the business.  I would like to help companies make product management and software decisions based off data driven insights.  As a someone who has acquired the tools of a data scientist I hope to be able to make the case for using predictive analytical tools to improve the reliability of a company's project budgeting and execution plan.

I believe the field of project management has a lot of room improvement as it relates to the insights and analytics of how the work is executed.  An example of where I think predictive analysis can help is on the project budgeting side.  When companies budget new initiatives they usually look at previous projects as a template.

How I think data science can help is by combining previous budgets with real-time data of the engineers throughputs.  When a team of engineers is doing the work they might not realize how a delay on a single task will impact delivery and overall spend.  With data science tools in python, we should be able to categorize bottlenecks and present data-driven alternatives that will allow the project get back on time and on budget.

```

* Describe your ideal job in one or two paragraphs as though you're talking with a non-technical family member or friend. Avoid jargon and keep things simple while remaining specific. If you went deep in your specialization above, emphasize here the breadth of skills and work.

```

The field of data science is about using data to optimize decisions.  As a project manager today I can see a lot of the estimates a company uses for budgets and resources are based on bad guesses.  I have rarely worked on a project that was budgeted and sized correclty.  From a personel and engineering perspective, companies usually underestimate the amount of resources they need to delivery on a particular date.

By Collecitng data and using the data science tools available in python, we should be able to augment our guesses and get to the bottom of our delays and impediements. More importantly a data scientist is good at describing insights in the data and presenting them in consumable charts and graphs for non-technical decisions makers to use.

In the end, our job as data scientists is to glean value in the data that a company is collecting but not necessarily leveraging.  The value is there we just have to illuminate it by cutting out the noise and condensing it a very nice chart or graph.

```

* Synthesize the two exercises above into a short aspirational "professional summary" that might be appropriate on your LinkedIn profile, resume, or portfolio in the future.

```

I am an efficiency enabler.  I am passionate about using data science tools to help companies delivery projects ahead of time and under budget.
