# Career_Aspiration_4.1.4
Unit 4 Lesson 1 Assignment 4

## Write your own story

## Estimated Time: 2-3 hours

Think about your ideal career two or three years from now. What particular skills have you built? What techniques and tools are your specialty? What accomplishments might you have made? Is your title "Data Scientist", or something different? Are you working in a particular industry, or solving a particular class of problems?

For this final assignment you have writing prompts about the ideal job you envision above. Write responses to each and add them to your planning document.

* Describe your ideal job in one or two paragraphs as though you're talking with an industry professional. They're familiar with the business and with the culture, they know the jargon and the buzzwords. Focus on the skills, tools, and / or industry you hope to deeply specialize in.

* Describe your ideal job in one or two paragraphs as though you're talking with a non-technical family member or friend. Avoid jargon and keep things simple while remaining specific. If you went deep in your specialization above, emphasize here the breadth of skills and work.

* Synthesize the two exercises above into a short aspirational "professional summary" that might be appropriate on your LinkedIn profile, resume, or portfolio in the future.
